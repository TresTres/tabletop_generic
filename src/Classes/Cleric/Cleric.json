      "description": "You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses."

If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cant take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."

      "description": "You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity\u2019s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."
