Others are m ore sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.",

W hen you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonm agical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.\nThe object can\u2019t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone."
