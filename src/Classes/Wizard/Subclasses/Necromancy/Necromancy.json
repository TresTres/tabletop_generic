  "description": "The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.\nMost people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.",

Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell\u2019s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy.

When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.\nWhenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:\nThe creature\u2019s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.\nThe creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls."

        "description": "Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can\u2019t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your com m ands until you use this feature again.\nIntelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free."
