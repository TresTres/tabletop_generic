The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals ld8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches. \n • The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will. \n • If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs-hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages.
